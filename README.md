PiHome is a home automation system, build on top of RaspberryPI. It allows residents to easily maneuver the home appliances with mobile or desktop responsive application. It also helps with scheduling, so no one needs to remember to turn on floor heating at 3AM or to close all window blinds at 11PM. Everyone can check sensors history, to get a feeling what was happening while they were away. PiHome allows to steer the main gate and garage gate, so everyone are comfortable to go for a walk without their keys in the pocket - mobile phone is good enough to get back to their premises.


From technical point of view, PiHome uses MongoDB hosted at Compose.io to store states of lights, heating pumps, hot water, window blinds and sensors (temperature, light). It has implementation of background workers, which process messages stream from RabbitMQ queue. Python backend uses also Celery, which helps with deferring events (like "close gate after 2 minutes"). Frontend part is made with AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap, which gives good experience on variety of devices (desktop, mobile or tablet). There are various implementation of "switch", from ready-made ethernet  device to low-level GPIO operations. Cron is used for managing schedules provided by users.
